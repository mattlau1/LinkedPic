# Usability
### Alerts always appear in the same spot
### Users are always notified if they do something on the web app (i.e comment, follow)
### Navbar is present on every page (except for login/register)
### Users can search for other users using search bar
### Web app is responsive so that mobile users can still use the site
### Navbar collapses for mobile devices

# Accessibility
### Consistent colour scheme across the entire web app
### Good Contrast between background colour and font color for all elements
### Content is always at or near the center of the screen
### Links and buttons are easily identifiable via bolded links & button background/outline
### Text is always present next to icons to help user understand what the button/link is for
### There is always a label or placeholder for every input
### Searching for users, commenting on a post or posting an image can be submitted without using a mouse (with Enter key)
